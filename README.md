# Solutions_Online-CodeProblems
A large repo collecting my solutions for various online coding problems.

The solutions are in varius languages, but mostly in Python.

The problems are organized by the website they are from.
The folder name indicate the website and 
the name of each file indicate the problem name.

Most of the solutions has been fitted with a test case, to show the results of the algorithm.

## LeetCode
Some of the problems from LeetCode are marked with (ALT), These
are solutions that I found online that I thought were interesting.
Typically, they are deemed more efficient than my own solutions, by the LeetCode system.
